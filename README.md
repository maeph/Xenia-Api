Xenia-Api
=========

Api for Xenia - JUG drawing machine based on Meetup (EventBrite coming soon!) which allows you to draw prizes on events and to keep track of them. It guarantees fair drawing - no participant will win two times an event and any prize more than once. You should have java and maven installed to run:

 mvn spring-boot:run
 
 Designed to work with Xenia-ng.
